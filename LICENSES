## esp8266 SDK and C library (Newlib)

Licenses:
1) Espressif MIT license, which as of 2016-08-11 covers everything from the 
NON-OS SDK (also driver_lib)

2) As we are using the GCC-based toolchain [1], there are some extra
includes and libs that we use from the Xtensa SDK:
    -newlib-xtensa (libc.a), available at [2]
        which is covered by multiple licenses:
        -- newlib: a long list of (apparently MIT-compatible?) licenses [3]
        -- libgloss: a long list of (apparently MIT-compatible?) licenses [4]
        -- newlib has some m4 script files which are under (L)GPL. However,
        my understanding is that these do not taint the newlib library
        with GPL.
    -lx106-hal (libhal.a) available at [5], from Tensilica 
        covered by the MIT license
    -include files in include.tgz
        There are some GPL licensed headers, (which seem to be C++
        related), but they have this special restriction:

        /* As a special exception, if you link this library with other
         * files,some of which are compiled with GCC, to produce an
         * executable, this library does not by itself cause the resulting
         * executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
         * This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
         * the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public 
         * License.  */

        See ./xcc/c++/xtensa-elf/bits/gthr-single.h in include.tgz for an example
